This project aims to gain valuable insights into user behavior, restaurant performance, 
and overall trends on the Swiggy food delivery platform. By analyzing order data,
we can uncover hidden patterns and answer key questions to
improve the Swiggy experience for both customers and restaurants.

Data:

The project will focus on a dataset containing Swiggy order information, potentially including columns like:

id (unique identifier for the order)
order_id (external order identifier)
order_total (total amount paid for the order)
restaurant_name (name of the restaurant the order was placed from)
order_time (timestamp of the order placement)
rain_mode (indication of whether it was raining at the time of the order)
on_time (whether the order was delivered on time)
(Optional) Additional columns might include user ID, item details, delivery location, etc. (depending on data availability)
